Please compile the kernel in the pintos/src/utils directory since even agter modifying my .bashrc file pintos is not available in any other directory other then utils

To run the test please write ./pintos run hello instead of pintos run hello since writing pintos run hello shows an error saying "No command pintos found".

The test files are named awesome.c and awesome.h in the src/tests/threads directory.

I have made changes in the following files.

1. In the file tests.c in pintos/src/tests/threads I have addeed my test in the list of static const struct test tests[] i.e "test",test_hello in the data structur struct test tests[].
2. In the file tests.h I have added the line extern test_func test_hello.
3. In the file Make.tests I have added test/threads_SRC += tests/threads/awesome.c
